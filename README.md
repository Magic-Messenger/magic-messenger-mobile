## ⚠️ Source-Available Project

This repository is **source-available**, not open source.

You are welcome to **inspect and audit** the code.  
You are **not permitted** to modify, redistribute, or deploy it.

See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for full terms.

---

## 🔍 Why Source-Available?

We believe privacy software must be **verifiable**, but not **exploitable**.

Making our source code available allows:

- Independent security researchers to audit cryptographic design
- Users to verify our privacy claims
- Transparency around data handling and architecture

At the same time, unrestricted open-source licensing would allow:

- Cloning of the product
- Deployment of modified versions
- Abuse of infrastructure, trust signals, and user expectations

> **Source-available strikes the balance**: transparency without sacrificing  
> user safety, brand integrity, or long-term sustainability.
